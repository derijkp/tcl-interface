interface
=========  Tcl interfaces
           by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen) 

What is the interface package
-----------------------------

The interface package contains some tools to work with "interfaces" in Tcl.
In Tcl "objects" can be created in many ways: in C, in Tcl or in any of the Tcl OO
extensions. The term object is used loosely here for each compound command: a command with 
subcommands (methods).

An interface is a set of (related) methods that provide a predefined functionality.
An object implements an interface if it supports all the methods in the interface the 
proper way. It can advertise this fact via the interface subcommand. Of course, one 
object can support multiple interfaces.

An interface is defined by the creation of an object in the interfaces namespace, 
that supports the "interface" interface. (don't you just love self referential definitions?).
This interface defining object must have a name consisting of the interface name and its version number 
seperated by a hyphen. It should have a doc method that returns the description of the
interface in XML format (TMML), and a test method that can be used to test a given object for 
compliance. The test method takes the object to be tested as a first argument, optionally 
followed by a number of options.

Installation
------------
You should be able to obtain the latest version of interface via www on url
http://rrna.uia.ac.be/interface/ or via anonymous ftp
on rrna.uia.ac.be. in the directory /pub/tcl

Usually you can build the binaries and install the package using the following steps:
cd to the interface directory
cd build
./configure
make install

The configure command has several options that can be examined using
/configure --help

How to contact me
-----------------
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc.
However, the development of interface is not my only task,
which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would
like.
